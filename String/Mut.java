/* üìö **CONCEPT NOTES:**

‚úÖ **String in Java:**
   - Strings are immutable in Java (once created, cannot be changed).
   - Any modification creates a new object in heap memory.

‚úÖ **Why are Strings Immutable?**
   - Security: Prevents unauthorized modifications (e.g., in class loaders).
   - Caching: String literals are cached in the String pool.
   - Synchronization: Strings are thread-safe.

‚úÖ **Memory Management:**
   - **Heap Memory:** Stores objects.
   - **String Pool:** Special memory area within the heap for string literals.
   - **Garbage Collection:** Unused string objects are removed.

‚úÖ **Mutable Strings in Java:**
   - **StringBuffer:** Thread-safe, synchronized, slower.
   - **StringBuilder:** Non-thread-safe, faster, better for single-threaded programs.

‚úÖ **Difference Between == and .equals():**
   - `==` compares references (memory addresses).
   - `.equals()` compares the content of strings.

/* üìå **INTERVIEW & PLACEMENT QUESTIONS WITH ANSWERS:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **What is the difference between String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder?**
   - String: Immutable
   - StringBuffer: Mutable, thread-safe
   - StringBuilder: Mutable, not thread-safe

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Why are strings immutable in Java?**
   - For security, caching, and thread-safety.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Explain the difference between == and .equals() when comparing strings.**
   - `==` checks memory reference, `.equals()` checks content.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **What is the String Constant Pool?**
   - A memory area in the heap for string literals to avoid duplication.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Which is faster: StringBuffer or StringBuilder? Why?**
   - StringBuilder, because it is not synchronized.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **What happens when you modify a String in Java?**
   - A new string object is created.

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Explain the concept of garbage collection in relation to Strings.**
   - Unused string objects are removed to free memory.

8Ô∏è‚É£ **Why is it recommended to use StringBuilder over StringBuffer in single-threaded applications?**
   - StringBuilder is faster as it avoids synchronization overhead.

9Ô∏è‚É£ **Can a string object be garbage collected? If yes, when?**
   - Yes, if there are no active references.

10Ô∏è‚É£ **How does JVM handle string literals?**
   - JVM stores string literals in the String Constant Pool for memory efficiency.
