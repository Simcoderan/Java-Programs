// 📌 NAMING CONVENTIONS IN JAVA

// 📚 **INTRODUCTION TO NAMING CONVENTIONS**
// - Naming conventions make the code more readable and maintainable.
// - They follow specific patterns based on the type of identifier (class, method, variable, etc.).

// 📚 NAMING CONVENTIONS IN JAVA:

// ✅ Class and Interface Names:
//    - Start with an uppercase letter.
//    - Use PascalCase.
//    - Example: Calculator, MyData
// ✅ Variables and Method Names:
//    - Start with a lowercase letter.
//    - Use camelCase.
//    - Example: marks, showMyMarks()
// ✅ Constants:
//    - Use uppercase letters.
//    - Separate words with underscores.
//    - Example: MAX_VALUE, PI
// ✅ Constructors:
//    - Same name as the class.
//    - Start with an uppercase letter.
// ✅ Packages:
//    - Use lowercase letters.
//    - Example: java.util




/* 📚 CONCEPT NOTES:

✅ Why Use Naming Conventions?
   - Improves code readability.
   - Reduces code maintenance effort.

✅ Best Practices:
   - Follow standard conventions for class, variables, and constants.
   - Avoid single-letter variable names (except for loops).

✅ Key Rules:
   - Class names: PascalCase.
   - Method/Variable names: camelCase.
   - Constants: UPPERCASE.

/* 📌 INTERVIEW & PLACEMENT QUESTIONS WITH ANSWERS:

1️⃣ What is camelCase in Java?
   - camelCase means starting with a lowercase letter and capitalizing each subsequent word.

2️⃣ What is PascalCase?
   - PascalCase means starting each word with an uppercase letter.

3️⃣ Why are constants written in uppercase?
   - To differentiate them from variables and indicate immutability.

4️⃣ How should class names be written in Java?
   - Class names should start with uppercase letters and follow PascalCase.

5️⃣ What are some examples of naming conventions?
   - Class: MyClass
   - Variable: myVariable
   - Constant: MAX_LIMIT

6️⃣ Why follow naming conventions?
   - For clarity, readability, and easier debugging.

7️⃣ Can variable names start with numbers?
   - No, variable names cannot start with numbers.

8️⃣ What are reserved keywords in Java?
   - Words like `class`, `interface`, and `final` cannot be used as variable names.

9️⃣ Are naming conventions enforced by the compiler?
   - No, but they are strongly recommended.

🔟 What happens if naming conventions are ignored?
   - Code becomes hard to read and maintain.
