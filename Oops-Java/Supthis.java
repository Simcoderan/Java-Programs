/*  üìå MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE IN JAVA
 Multilevel inheritance occurs when a class is derived from a class that is already derived from another class.
Java supports multilevel inheritance, where a subclass inherits from a superclass, and another subclass inherits from the first subclass.*/


class D extends Object {  // Every class in Java extends Object class implicitly, even if not mentioned.
    public D() {
        super();  // Calls the constructor of the Object class (implicitly there)
        System.out.println("in D");
    }

    public D(int z) {
        super();  // Calls the constructor of the Object class (implicitly there)
        System.out.println("in int D");
    }
}

class E extends D {  // Class E inherits from class D (multilevel inheritance)
    public E() {
        super();  // Calls the constructor of D (implicitly there)
        System.out.println("in E");
    }

    public E(int z) {
        this();  // Calls the default constructor of class E, which will call D's constructor first
        System.out.println("with int E");
    }
}

public class Supthis {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an object of class E using the constructor with an integer parameter
        E obj3 = new E(6);  // Output: in D, in E, with int E
    }
}







/*üìö Key Concepts:

Multilevel Inheritance:
When class E inherits from class D, and class D inherits from Object (implicitly).
Class E is indirectly a subclass of Object through D.

Constructor Call:
The super() call is automatically added to call the constructor of the superclass.
You can explicitly call super() or this() in the subclass constructor to invoke the parent or sibling class constructor.

Constructor Flow in Multilevel Inheritance:
If a subclass has multiple constructors, you can call the parent class constructors using super(), and even call sibling constructors using this().

Implicit super():
Even if super() is not mentioned, it‚Äôs called by default to invoke the constructor of the Object class, which is the root class in Java.





üìå Interview Questions:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What is multilevel inheritance?
Multilevel inheritance occurs when a class derives from another class, and that class is derived from another, forming a chain.


2Ô∏è‚É£ Does every class in Java extend the Object class?
Yes, every class in Java implicitly extends the Object class, even if it's not explicitly mentioned.


3Ô∏è‚É£ What is the role of super() in a constructor?
super() is used to call the constructor of the superclass. If not mentioned, the default constructor is called automatically.


4Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between super() and this() in constructors?
super() calls the constructor of the superclass.
this() calls another constructor in the same class.


5Ô∏è‚É£ Can we call super() multiple times in a constructor?
No, super() can only be called once, and it must be the first statement in the constructor.


6Ô∏è‚É£ What happens when super() is not explicitly used?
Java automatically calls the no-argument constructor of the superclass.


7Ô∏è‚É£ What is the significance of the Object class in Java?
All Java classes inherit from the Object class, which provides common methods like toString(), equals(), and hashCode(). 


8Ô∏è‚É£ Can super() and this() be used together?
No, super() and this() cannot be used in the same constructor because both must be the first statement in the constructor.*/
